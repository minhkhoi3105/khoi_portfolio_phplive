                    Hello, my name is Khoi, I am a 2nd-year student at NBCC of Web and Mobile Application Development program. I'm also an international student from Vietnam who is currently staying in Canada to explore new experiences in a country I have never been to before. With the strong set skills of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, C#, ASP.NET MVC, Node.js, Angular, SQL, and related web development skills, I am confident to build business applications with those skills and also using Agile Methodologies to control the workflow of the team well. 

                    On the other hand, I had a chance to volunteer at Rodgers Rental Inc as a maintenance worker for apartment buildings. With this volunteer experience, I improved myself in the aspect of communication skills and customer service, so I am not shy at all to help people out whenever challenges come to me. More than that, I have been studying at NBCC for 2 years and most of the time I have been dealing with virtual works due to Covid-19. Therefore, I am in good control of working with teams virtually or physically. In general, I am looking forward to working in a Web Developer position, and my passion of being a Web Developer never stops burning, I will be glad to work with any teams to build amazing applications. Cheers!
